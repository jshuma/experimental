# Assignment 5.1 Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?

In the attached dataset, a close analysis was performed on whether customers would accept a proposed coupon based on various characteristics of the driver and of the situation. The following characteristics were evaluated:
- Baseline acceptance (whether a customer indicated acceptance)
- The establishment type that the coupon offered a discount for
- The ambient temperature when the coupon was offered
- The frequency at which the customer attends bars in a typical month
- The age of the driver
- The presence of passengers, along with their ages
- The driver's occupation
- The driver's marital status (particularly whether they were widowed)
- The frequency at which the customer attends coffee shops in a typical month

Overall findings were:
- Customers in general accepted coupons at a rate of 56.84%.
- Bar coupons in particular were accepted at a rate of 41% overall.
- _Frequent_ bar customers (those visiting at least four times a month) accepted coupons at a much higher rate of 76.88%.
- _Moderately frequent_ bar customers (those visiting more than once a month), over 25, accepted it at a rate of 69.52%.
- A specially-defined class (with non-kid passengers, visiting moderate frequently, and who weren't employed in farming, fishing, or forestry) accepted at a rate of 71.79%.
- Those going to bars more than once per month, under age 30, exceeded that special class, at 72%.
- Customers presumed to have less disposable income (those going to cheap restaurants over 4 times per month, with income under $50,000) accepted it significantly less frequently (45%).

This analysis suggests that prior frequency of bar attendance is the most significant predictor of coupon acceptance, followed by age of the driver.

Similar findings, albeit less-dramatic ones, were observed with coffee houses: Customers visiting at least once a month were 63% likely to accept a coffeehouse coupon, compared with 51% of those visiting less frequently.
